Interested in becoming more involved with Any Rat Rescue? We are looking for people with enthusiasm, passion, and a love of rats to join our efforts.

Help by being a “quarantine” home: Perhaps you can be a quarantine home. To prevent the spread of
illness, all rats need to be quarantined in a separate building, with a separate air supply, for three weeks
prior to being introduced to other rats. Our limited number of quarantine homes greatly inhibits our ability
to take in rats. A quarantine house needs to be a home that houses no other rodents.
Help by being a foster home: You can become a foster family … rats need foster parents, too! ARR
pays medical expenses, and you provide food, cleaning, socialization and LOVE!

We have MANY volunteer opportunities. Please contact us to learn how you can make a difference.

Fostering:

We are in great need of foster homes. Since Any Rat Rescue does not have a brick-and-mortar shelter, the number of foster homes we have directly impacts the number of rats we can help. We turn rats away every day because we have nowhere to house them.

If you have room in your home and your heart, please contact us for more information or fill out our foster application to get started.

Any Rat Rescue will pay for any medical expenses your foster rat may need. All you need to provide is food, cleaning, socialization and LOVE!

Quarantine Homes:

Any Rat Rescue prides itself on good quality health care for their rats and this starts with the quarantine home. In order to make an accurate assessment of a rat's health, rats are quarantined for three weeks where they undergo a course of medication for common infections. After these three weeks the rescue can then move the rats to other homes with a much lower risk of infection transmission to other rats. If you have a home with no other rodents we would greatly appreciate your support as a quarantine house.

Event support and Fundraising

Any Rat Rescue relies on volunteers to help at events. We often participate in adoption events with other rescues. These events require several volunteers to run smoothly. We often have some of our rats at these events for potential adopters to meet. Events allow the rescue to share information about rats and how to care for them.
